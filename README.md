# Background and Purpose
We were assigned to add on to our PlanMyTrip app to make the app even more functional and interactive.  We were tasked to add things such as, the weather description for specific cities, potential travel destinations and to create a travel route between the four cities  as well as a marker layer map to display the data.

# How we got the data:
We were able to use both the open weather API as well as the google directions and places API to create the app.  After conducting the analysis using numpy to generate 2000 random latitudes and longitudes we exported the final data frames into csv files.
## CSV files:
1. [WeatherPy_vacation](vacation_search/WeatherPy_vacation.csv)
2. [cities](weather_data/cities.csv)
3. [WeatherPy_Database](Weather_Database/WeatherPy_Database.csv)
